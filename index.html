    So you'd like to know how to use impress.js?
    
    You've made the first, very important step - you're reading the source code.
    And that's how impress.js presentations are built - with HTML and CSS code.
    
    Believe me, you need quite decent HTML and CSS skills to be able to use impress.js effectively.
    And what is even more important, you need to be a designer, too, because there are no default
    styles for impress.js presentations, there is no default or automatic layout for them.
    
    You need to design and build it by hand.
    
    So...
    
    Would you still like to know how to use impress.js?

        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheet. Script adds all styles it needs for
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

<!--
    
    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
    
    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.
    
    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.
    
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported">

<!--
    For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
-->
<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
</div>

<!--
    
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
    
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.
    
    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective . Every step can have its own perspective 
    set with `data-perspective=".5"` giving it a multiplier for the default perspective.

    One configuration option that's shown here is `data-screens="0 left:right"` which
    means that this presentation supports two screen configurations: 
      * first, there's only one screen with the id '0'
      * second, there are two screens, called 'left' and 'right' (intended to be shown like that)
    
    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesing things
    right around the corner of this tag ;)
    
-->
<div id="impress" data-screens="0 left:right">

    <!--
        
        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
        
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
        
        It will not be rotated or scaled.
        
        Each step can specify on which screens it should appear: this step
        has `data-screen="0 left right"` which means it will be shown on all the
        screens in our two configurations.
    -->
    <div id="bored" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500" data-screen="0 left right">
        <q>Aren't you just <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>
    </div>

    <!-- 
        In the presentation console and remote control, you can see speaker
        notes. These are text or HTML coming from elements with a class name
        of `stepnotes`.

        For any step, the nearest *preceding* step notes are shown, so the
        notes below will show from step 2 until overridden again. If you want
        notes for the first step, the notes element must precede the first
        step element.

        The default CSS hides the notes.
    -->
    <div class="stepnotes">
        example speaker notes
        the default console/remote control style sheets preserve line breaks in speaker notes, for ease of authoring
    </div>

    <!--
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.

        The ID can be useful for styling (as shown in the CSS), but also for relative positioning:

        The following step is positioned 1000 pixels to the right of the first step, because it has
        data-rel="#bored", which means that the above step, with its ID "bored", becomes the origin
        position of this step here.

        Relative positioning like this is useful if you want to move steps around when creating or
        tweaking your presentations.
        
    -->
    <div id="bored2" class="step slide" data-rel="#bored" data-x="1000" data-screen="0 left right">
        <q>Don't you think that presentations given <strong>in modern browsers</strong> shouldn't <strong>copy the limits</strong> of 'classic' slide decks?</q>
    </div>

    <div id="bored3" class="step slide" data-rel="#bored2" data-x="1000" data-screen="0 left right">
        <q>Would you like to <strong>impress your audience</strong> with <strong>stunning visualization</strong> of your talk?</q>
    </div>

    <div class="stepnotes">
        new step notes, these will apply to all the remaining steps
    </div>

    <!--
        
        This is an example of step element being scaled.
        
        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
        down (4 times) to make it back to its correct size.
        
        This is also an example of a step that is part of a multiscreen step:
        `data-screen="0 left*"` means this step will appear on screen '0' as usual, 
        but it will also appear on the left screen along with the next step. 

        Screen `left*` means this step is in a series of steps that define what's on 
        various screens; in our case we have two screens (notice `left:right` above), 
        so we expect another step that will come on the right screen.
        (See the comment on the next step.)

        If the browser has screen 'left' selected, it will display this step.
        If the browser has screen 'right' selected, it will skip this step
        (because `left` is in the group `left:right`) and go ahead looking for the next
        step that has 'right' in its screens.
    
        In a presentation, the body element gets the class based on active
        screen name `impress-screen-NAME` (where NAME is the screen's
        name)... For example when showing the "right" screen, the body
        element gets a class of `impress-screen-right`.

        This can be used by the CSS for example to hide some content that
        shouldn't be getting in the way on some screens.

        The parts with class `hidden-on-bis` will be hidden when this step is
        reused later in the presentation (only in multi-screen setup though).

    -->
    <div id="title" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0" data-scale="4" data-screen="0 left*">
        <span class="try"><span class="hidden-on-bis">then</span> you should try</span>
        <h1>impress.js<sup>*</sup></h1>
        <span class="footnote hidden-on-bis"><sup>*</sup> no rhyme intended</span>
    </div>

    <!--
        
        This element introduces rotation.
        
        Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
        element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

        This step also has `data-screen="0 right"` so that it appears on the right screen. 
        Because it has `right` and not `right*`, this step becomes the final in this series of steps 
        on our two screens (in this case it's the step above and this one).
         
        Also, in a presentation, when a screen shows a step different from
        the one that is the final in a set of screens shown together (like
        here, the left screen would be showing the step above but both
        screens would act like they are on the step below), the body gets
        `impress-on-ID` classes from both steps. In our case, when showing
        the left screen, we'd have both `impress-on-title` and
        `impress-on-its` on the root element.
    -->
    <div id="its" class="step" data-x="850" data-y="3000" data-rotate="90" data-scale="5" data-screen="0 right">

    </div>

    <!--
        
        And now it gets really exciting! We move into third dimension!
        
        Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
        `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
        positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

        This step has `data-screen="0 right"` which in our situation means that
        it shows on the right screen and the left screen stays the same as it
        was (because 'right' is final, while 'right*' would mean the browser looks
        for a next step on screen 'left').
        
    -->
    <div id="tiny" class="step" data-x="2825" data-y="4025" data-z="-3000" data-rotate="300" data-scale="1" data-screen="0 right">
        <p>and <b>tiny</b> ideas</p>
    </div>

    <!--
        
        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.
        
        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
        
        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.
        
        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.
        
        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.

    <!--

        Sometimes in a presentation it's useful to hide everything. 
        A step with data-group="blank" is styled to do just that.

        But here we need a normal step before that to say this is happening.

        Notice that the pre-blank message only shows on the right screen, but
        the blank step shows on both screens, finally replacing the "big"
        step on the left screen.

        This step again shows on both screens; then the following one uses
        the right screen only, and then it's back to both screens.

        And the last two show the full power and flexibility of impress.js.
        
        You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
        So the display on the left screen will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees 
        anticlockwise) around X axis and 10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis,
        and the display on the right screen will look more from the side.
        
        You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
        as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

        So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        * `data-screen` - defines the screens (in a multi-screen setup) on which a step will show up; 
            the default value is '0' for only the default one screen.
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult

        from the title step.

    -->
    <div id="title-bis" class="step" data-group="title" data-x="0" data-y="0" data-scale="4" data-screen="right*">
    </div>

    <div id="mainoverview" class="step" data-x="3000" data-y="1400" data-scale="11" data-screen="0 left">
    </div>
    
</div>

    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.
    
    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.
    
    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.
    
    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.
    
    ...
    
    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
    
    Just sayin' ;)
    
-->
<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) { 
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>



<!--
    Presenter console:
       open it by pressing 'c', then move the new browser tab/window on your
       laptop screen while the presentation is on the projector

    To have the presenter console, you need to include queryparams.js and
    impress-console.js before initializing impress. It can safely be included
    before or after including impress.js itself, but it has to be included
    before the impress init() call.
-->
<script src="js/queryparams.js"></script>
<script src="js/impress-console.js"></script>

<!--
    Multiscreen console:
       open it by pressing 's', it will replace the presentation with a view
       that allows you to select a screen bundle and then shows the multiple
       screens

    To have the multiscreen console, you need to include queryparams.js and
    impress-multiscreen-console.js before initializing impress. It can safely
    be included before or after including impress.js itself, but it has to be
    included before the impress init() call.
-->
<script src="js/impress-multiscreen-console.js"></script>

<!--
    Remote control view:
        open it by pressing 'o', it will replace the presentation with a view
        that acts as a remote control for this presentation. The presentation
        URI can have a query parameter "key",
        e.g. http://jacek.soc.port.ac.uk/impress.js/?key=sdb
        which enables the remote control functionality, and allows the same
        presentation to be given simultaneously without remote control
        interference.

    See README.md for more information on the remote control.

    The impress-rcview.js script should be loaded before the call to
    impress(), but after the element that contains the steps.
-->
<script src="js/impress-rcview.js"></script>

<!--
    Remote control implementation:
    
    For controlling a presentation from another device, the remote control
    script opens a WebSocket channel to an impress-server (see
    https://github.com/jacekkopecky/impress-server) presumed running on the
    machine that served the presentation files.

    You can press `p` to be able to set the presentation key (the same
    presentation can be given in multiple places independently if the places
    use different RC keys). Setting also the password means the presentation
    will now forward all next()/prev()/goto() events to all listening
    presentations.

    The impress-rc.js script should be loaded before the call to impress().
-->
<script src="js/impress-rc.js"></script>

<!--
    
    Last, but not least.
    
    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
    
-->
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>
'use strict';
(function(){
    var query = parseQueryParams();

    var options = {};
    options.hashChanges = !query.disableHash;
    if (query.screen) options.screen = query.screen[0];

    impress().init(options);
})();
</script>

<!--
    
    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
    
    Just store the result of the call:
    
        var api = impress();
    
    and you will get some functions you can call:
    
        `api.init(options)` - initializes the presentation; 
            options is an object with the following properties:
                `hashChanges` (default: true) enables updates to location URI to reflect the current step
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
    
    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
    
    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.

    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
    you start...
    
    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?
    
    You have it open in text editor?
    
    Stop right there!
    
    That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
    first needs to grow in your mind.
    
    So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.
    
    Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
    to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.
    
    Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
    it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.
    
    If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about 
    creating awesome and engaging presentations.
    
    Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.

    I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like
    to congratulate you personally :)
    
    But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,
    or anything you like to drink. And raise a glass for me ;)
